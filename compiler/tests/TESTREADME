Guide for using the test input, outputs, and scripts
It is likely that we will combine all lexemes into a single file once we are 
further along. 

Compiler Input Files:
-- int.txt      -- has numbers to test the integer lexeme in compiler
-- punc.txt     -- has punctuation like ; ( ) to test punctuation lexeme
-- str.txt      -- has all letters and numbers in quotations
-- err.txt      -- tests the possible lexeme errors
-- hello.txt    -- kestrel code for hello world
-- fib.txt      -- kestrel code for fibonacci code

Output files:
	NOTE: Until we change the compiler outputs, these files must end with a
	      single whitespace ' ' and the newline at the end must be removed
	      in tscript with tr -d. Since cat cannot show whitespace, we will
	      use an echo script to keep things tidy to one file.
