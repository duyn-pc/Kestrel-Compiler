# Kestrel Compiler
This is a class project with three fellow class members to create a compiler for the [Kestrel Language](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/compiler/kestrel/) using C++. This was the final project for the University of Iowa's 2018 Compiler Construction class.

## To Run
Project is designed for Linux. Clone compiler folder to your system.
In linux terminal, enter the "compiler" directory and type "make".
Type "./kestrel" + name of Kestrel file to start compiler. 

## My Contributions
Developed most of the test scripting. Files: tscript, tests folder
Built Punctuation module for lexical analyzer. Files: puncmap.cpp, lexical.cpp
Parsed the StartFollowSets for all the classes such as element.cpp, environment.cpp, block.cpp, etc. 

## Disclaimer
Project has not been maintained or updated in a while so it may not work as intended. I just transfered the repository from SVN.
